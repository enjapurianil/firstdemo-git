What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine working on a project at home and while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution to a code error that has kept you restless for days.

You cannot make these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with a command on whatever computer you have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.

In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform. Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to collaborate with other developers from any location.

Now that we have created and initialized our project locally, let's push it to GitHub.

If you are a beginner, you will come across some new terms like push, commit, add, and so on â€“ but do not be overwhelmed by them. With some practice you will be able to remember these terms and what they do.
